# Evaluate Your Snowflake ML Models and Detect Drifts
Ever trained a model inside Snowflake and thought, "What's next?"ðŸ¤” How do you keep it accurate and prevent it from drifting awayðŸŽ¯? In this repo, which I demoed on stage at the Snowflake World Tour London 2024, I will share the basic techniques to evaluate and monitor your ML models!

Snowflake ML is the integrated set of capabilities for end-to-end machine learning on a single platform next to your governed data. Snowflake ML can be used for streamlined and fully custom workflows.

The architecture above illustrates the basics steps of how we will execute the model evaluation and monitoring process:
1. We first store our baseline model metrics along with the model inside the `Model Registry`. This could be ROC AUC and Accuracy in our case, but can also be MAPE, RMSE, etc.
2. As we receive new data, we can monitor the model metrics over time and if any features have drifted. We can generate reports if necessary and automatically alert the data scientists if there is significant drifts
3. We can retrain the existing model using the new data, given that it is a credible amount of data, and compare the model performance.
4. If we think the new model, which likely will perform better against the new data, is a better representation of the data going forward, we can promote that new model into the `Model Registry` as the latest version. This will allow our end-users to always have the most accurate model.


### What We'll Do in the Notebooks:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Fetch claims and customer data from the GitHub repository.
2. **Transformation and Feature Engineering**: Utilize Snowpark DataFrames for data preparation and analysis. We also save this into our Feature Store (With a tiny bit of LLM fun ðŸ˜‰)
3. **Model Training**: We Train an XGBoost Classifier model and store it in the Snowflake Model Registry
4. **Model Metrics**: Utilize Accuracy and ROC AUC scores to understand our model performance. With new claims data, we need to understand if the model accuracy has changed
5. **Drift Detection**: We utilize Population Stability Index and Kernel Density Estimates to help us understand if there are any feature drifts
6. **Drift Report**: We will produce drift reports, both as a Streamlit app and email notification
7. **Automate retraining pipeline**: We can package the model retraining and registering into a function and schedule the notebook to run over time

## Requirements
- We are using the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role in this case. If you are using a different role, ensure the appropriate privileges are granted.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using a trial account, the `SETUP.sql` part will give you some errors. Specifically, you will not be able to create `NETWORK RULE` and `INTEGRATION` since this feature is not enabled for trial accounts. So please ignore those. Similarly, instead of running the first notebook (i.e. part 0), you will need to manually upload the `csv` files into Snowflake and in the `DATA` schema.

## Setup
1. Run the `Setup.sql` script in Snowflake, this will create all the necessary objects
- **Database**: `SWT2024_DEMO_AUTO_INSURANCE`
- **Schema**: `NOTEBOOK` and `Data`
- **Warehouse**: `Demo_WH`
- **Network Rule**: `GITHUB_NETWORK_RULE`
- **External Access Integration**: `GITHUB_EXTERNAL_ACCESS_INTEGRATION`
- **NOTIFICATION INTEGRATION**: `drift_report_email_integration`
2. Upload the 3 Notebooks into the `SWT2024_DEMO_AUTO_INSURANCE.NOTEBOOK` schema
3. Run through each of the notebooks and enjoy!
4. If you are interested to see model drift report in Streamlit, install the Streamlit app in the `NOTEBOOK` schema in the same database.
